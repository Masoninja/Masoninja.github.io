Part of why I started working on the desktop was because my laptop, which i used before all of this,
would get very hot and then shut down. This problem ended up corrupting the system, and my laptop was unable to 
stay on long enough to reinstall windows. Since i had the destop up and running, i figured i might as well see 
if my laptop could be fixed.

Removing the keyboard from my laptop greatly increased the air flow for it, so it was able
to stay running long enough to re-install windows and install a program to assess the problems with the hardware.

After managing to get Windows reinstalled, I used HWMonitor to check the hardware, revealing that even with
the top of the laptop open, with the fan seemingly working just fine, the idling temperatures were all around 100°C. 
At this point, I powered the machine back down and started taking is apart further to check the heat sink and CPU.

Taking everything apart revealed that there was little to no thermal paste at all on the CPU, and what was there
had a chalky, hard texture. I cleaned off what was there, vaccuumed out alll the dust, and applied new thermal paste, then 
reassembled the machine.

When the machine was completely reassembled, i booted it up and ran HWMonitor to check the new temperature, which
were now idling at around 70-72°C, and when stress-tested, capped out at 75-76°C.

So far, it's run very smoothly!
